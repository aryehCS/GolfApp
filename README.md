# GolfApp
Golf App for project 2 in CST 338
Description:
/* This application will take in golf scores from the user. From these scores, the app will calculate a handicap along with an output for the lowest score, highest score, and average score. A handicap is a measuring system golfers use to approximate their skill level using an integer. The app will also include a “drills” game that utilizes a deck of cards attached to golf clubs and types of shots. The user can take the given card that the app provides and practice that shot in reality. */
